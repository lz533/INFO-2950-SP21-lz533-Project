Question: how is certain personal experience shaping risky consumption behavior among young adults

Context: Even before the current pandemic, "deaths of despair" has been rising in much of the U.S., especially among Middle-aged (35~49) males w/out a college degree. 
  "deaths of despair" conceptually include suicide, fatal substance overdose, or accidents. 
  Certain behavioral cues predispose people to such risks. Among them certain spending patterns (habitual spending on alcohol, tobacco, opioids, antidepressants, fast food).
  Alarming to me is how such behaviour can proliferate among young adults.
I plan to explore trends among young adults that would expose them to risky spending behavior.
  It is a big question to ask. I plan to narrow the potential causes to a specific experience domain (e.g. academic stress, types of employment, job turnaround after graduation)
  Alternatively, certain environmental trends (student loan? sounds nice).

Data: for consumption, I anticipate relying heavily on the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CSS).
